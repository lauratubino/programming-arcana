\label{sub:program-creation-c_statement}

In a \nameref{sub:statement} you are commanding the computer to perform an action. There are only a small number of statements you can choose from. At this stage the only statement is the \nameref{sub:procedure call}, technically the \emph{procedure statement} in C++. This is shown in Figure \ref{csynt:program-creation-statement}, where we can see that at this stage all Statements are calls to \nameref{sub:procedure}s.

\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
  \item The code in Listing \ref{lst:program-creation-c-knights} contains a \nameref{sub:program_in_c}.
  \item This Program contains five procedure calls, see \nameref{sub:program-creation-c_procedure_call}.
  \item Each procedure call runs the \csnipet{write_line} or \csnipet{write} procedure to output text to the Terminal. See the section on \nameref{sub:c_console_output}.
\end{itemize}
