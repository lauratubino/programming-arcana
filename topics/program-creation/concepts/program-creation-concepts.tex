\section{Program Creation Concepts} % (fold)
\label{sec:program_creation_concepts}

Our first program is going to display some text to the Terminal. In this section you will be introduced to the programming artefacts and terminology you will need to use to create this program. This first step is important and will require you to have installed a C++ or Pascal compiler, see \cref{cha:building programs} \nameref{cha:building programs} for instructions.

A programming \textbf{artefact} is something that can be created and used within your code. In this chapter we will look at creating programs, and using a number of other artefacts. The following artefacts will be covered in this chapter:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \nameref{sub:program}: A program is a sequence of instructions that when compiled creates an executable file that a user can run.
  \item \nameref{sub:procedure}: A procedure is a named sequence of instructions that will get the computer to perform a task. When you want the task performed you can call the procedure.
  \item \nameref{sub:library}: The program can use code from other Libraries. These libraries contain reusable Procedures and Types. 
  \item \nameref{sub:type}: A type defines how data is interpreted by the program. The programming language will support a number of basic types by default, and libraries can add other types. 
\end{itemize}

In addition to these artefacts, you will need to understand some programming \textbf{terminology}. The following terms are discussed in this section:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \nameref{sub:statement}: An \textbf{instruction} within the program.
  \item \nameref{sub:expression}: A \textbf{value} used in a statement.
  \item \nameref{sub:identifier}: The \textbf{name} of an artefact.
  % \item Literal: A part of an \textbf{expression} where the value is entered directly into the code.
\end{itemize}

This section also introduces the following kinds of instructions. You can use these to get the computer to perform certain \textbf{actions} within your program.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \nameref{sub:procedure call}: The instruction to run a procedure.
\end{itemize}

We can then use these concepts, artefacts, and instructions to create a program that will write some text to the Terminal as shown in Figure \ref{fig:program-creation-helloworld}.

\subsection{Summary} % (fold)
\label{sub:program_creation_concepts_summary}

This section has introduced a number of programming artefacts, some programming terminology, and one kind of instruction. An overview of these concepts is shown in Figure \ref{fig:program-creation-summary}. The next section will look at how you can use these concepts to design some small programs.

  \item \textbf{Artefacts} are things you can \emph{create} and \emph{use}.
  \item \textbf{Terms} are things you need to \emph{understand}.
  \item \textbf{Actions} are things you can \emph{command} the computer to perform.
